This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app - but no! It's a boilerplate created by myself`](https://github.com/santanapaulo/react-boilerplate-nextjs).

## Motivation

The main idea behind this project is to apply some concepts, such as **unit tests**, a **Storybook server**, some **Graphql**, which we integrate using **Apollo Client**.

Soooo, I hope you enjoy it. Any doubts, let me know.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
